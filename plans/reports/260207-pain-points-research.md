## KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS (from posts w/ 200-1800+ upvotes)

### What Actually Works
1. **Pick BORING industries** - plumbing, contractors, cleaning biz. Less competition, customers pay more
2. **Charge enterprise prices** - $500-2000/mo, NOT $29/mo consumer pricing
3. **Compliance/Risk reduction** - companies pay "stupid money" to avoid lawsuits/fines
4. **B2B > B2C** - "90% failing because building B2C apps. $20k MRR comes from ugly B2B tools for unsexy industries"
5. **Build 4mo, Market 14mo** - NOT the reverse. Get 10 paying customers before building anything fancy
6. **Don't compete with ChatGPT** - thin AI wrappers are dead. Value = domain expertise + workflow integration

### What DOESN'T Work
- Generic AI content tools (saturated, can't beat ChatGPT on price)
- "Find a pain point" advice without domain expertise
- Asking friends "would you pay?" (ask them TO pay instead)
- B2C lifestyle apps ($5/mo habit trackers for broke college students)

## QUICK-WIN STRATEGY
If I had to pick ONE to build this weekend and market Monday:

**AI Search Visibility Monitor** - because:

- Every SaaS founder on Reddit/HN/Twitter is worried about this
- Can MVP with web scraping + simple dashboard
- Clear monetization ($99-299/mo, SaaS founders will pay)
- Content marketing angle: "Is your product invisible to ChatGPT?" = viral blog post
- Low competition, high urgency
