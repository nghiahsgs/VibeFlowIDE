1. Introduction 
The population explosion to 9 billion by 2050 and urbanization will create pressure on the production system and the food supply chain globally, leading to a severe lack of natural resources. These issues have altered the climate, making living conditions increasingly unhealthy (Gunapala et al., 2025). Additionally, about one-third of the food ( about 2.2 billion tons) is wasted in the whole supply chain, while 13% of food loss occurs from harvest to retail, which reflects inefficiencies in supply chain management (UNFCCC, 2024). With that, agriculture faces the challenges of how to increase productivity to adapt to a high level of consumption while ensuring the responsibility of the environment, society, and economy (Boix-Fayos and de Vente, 2023) 
Through using theories and frameworks of sustainable supply chain management, this study proposes the implementation of a digital traceability system in crop agriculture by using real-time data to monitor resource use (soil, water, and energy) (Santos et al., 2026). From that, it aims to minimize the depletion of natural resources. This purpose is linked directly to Target 12 of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on Responsible Consumption and Production in 2030 (The Global Goals, 2025). Therefore, this plan will assess whether applying traceability can go beyond the short-term goal of avoiding trade fraud to become a core accountability management tool, which helps manage natural resources effectively.

2. Background and research 
2.1 Strategic Context 
Using the STEEPED framework to assess macroeconomic factors impacting crop agriculture and understand how these pressures contribute to exacerbating natural depletion.The supply of freshwater, rare earth metals, and fossil fuels is decreasing in the environment (Shahzad et al., 2023). Approximately 70 percent of the freshwater is used in farming; however, the old irrigation systems are very inefficient (Grafton et al., 2018). The use of synthetic fertilizers and burning of crop residues also damage the soil, pollute the water, and emit more nitrous oxide, which are the harmful effects of intensive farming (Bhatia, Jain and Pathak, 2013). In the long run, this causes climate change, reduced crop production, and low quality of crops. Increased CO₂ decreased the quantity of protein and minerals in the plants (Lal, 2009; Loladze, 2014).

In legal aspects, for example, regulations such as the UK Environment Act 2021 (UK Government, 2021) and the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) (Europa.eu, 2023) require businesses to be transparent about their environmental impact. However, a major barrier is the lack of data. Currently, the farm stage accounts for more total food loss than the manufacturing and retail sectors combined (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2026), but it still lacks real-time monitoring. Major companies such as Tesco and Waitrose have strict procedures, yet they still depend on static certifications like Global GAP. As admitted by the UK Government Food Strategy Report, this lack of practical monitoring data leads to the overuse of chemicals and directly hinders the achievement of SDG 12.

Social factors are creating dual pressure on resources. On one hand, the lack of workers due to urbanization forces food companies or farmers to increase the use of pesticides and herbicides to replace manual labor (Castro-Vargas et al., 2025). This can kill soil microorganisms and cause soil compaction. On the other hand, the new consumption trend, for example, the high demand for avocados and almonds, has led to excessive groundwater extraction in Chile and California (Yipinstitute.org, 2024). It clearly demonstrates how social behavior is impacting the sustainable ecosystem.
2.2 Dimensions of Responsibility
In the global crop agriculture supply chains, smallholder farmers, agricultural workers, and residents in farming regions are directly affected by resource scarcity. The relationship between this group and retail companies is often challenged by power asymmetry (Glavee-Geo, Engelseth and Buvik, 2021; Bogomolova et al., 2026). Price pressure from big companies forces farms to exploit soil resources to maintain short-term profit. Hence, to solve this problem, a responsible strategy requires businesses to shift from a traditional mindset to regenerative systems (Howard et al., 2019). This could be operationalized through specific indicators such as water use intensity and soil carbon, ensuring input resources for the future.

At the organization, the main responsibility lies with the supply chain- leading food companies or downstream businesses, which influence production standards, price, and resource use of suppliers. The big barrier to achieving target SDG 12 is internal conflicts of interest, as shareholders prioritize investing in short-term profits over long-term investments in resource conservation. Thereby, responsible governance requires agri-companies to protect natural resources as a strategic business for maintaining competitiveness and long-term survival, rather than considering it an incurred cost (Christopher, 2023, 32-37). Otherwise, there is a diversity of environmental management tools, such as ISO 14001, which support standardized processes and enhance transparency (Matanda et al., 2014). However, this will be less effective when the imbalance in financial and technological resources among partners occurs. If companies only impose standards without providing financial and technical support, small partners or farms could struggle to comply. Thus, it is hard to achieve the goals of SDG 12 (Lima et al., 2025).

Running out of natural resources has a direct impact on consumers through rising agricultural prices caused by increased production costs and low-nutrient fruits due to soil degradation. In this context, consumers play a role in shaping supply chain behavior. The pressure of the market is a motivation for companies to establish transparent environmental policies (Grant et al., 2023). However, the main challenge is balancing the desire for low prices with the responsibility of resource conservation. Therefore, to contribute to achieving SDG 12, consumers should recognize that higher prices may reflect the true costs of resource restoration instead of a financial burden 
2.3 Critical Evaluation
Crop agriculture in some countries operates in a linear model (take-make- dispose), based on exploiting resources without control. They focus on short-term production (Ellen Macarthur Foundation, 2019). Suppliers like farms or small businesses often burn agricultural by-products like straw, husks, and pulp, and directly discharge processing wastewater into the environment. Consequently, the natural process of soil will be gone with time, hence the land will be more prone to erosion. These practices added to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions; in India, the volume of GHG emissions due to the agricultural by-products alone has risen by 75 percent since 2011 (Deshpande et al., 2023), approximately 1.3 tons CO₂e per hectare annually. This depicts a lack of nutrient management under governance: the companies are profit-driven but do not think about the planet.

Conversely, the circular economy can provide the solution to environmental issues (Ortiz-de-Montellano et al., 2023) through the creation of goods without waste and the reuse of materials (Mestre and Cooper, 2017). One Indian company utilized aromatic waste of plants as organic fertilizer and planted it into its crops (Singh et al., 2024). This helps decreased over reply on exploiting new resources and reduces input costs. Normally, this model helps keep nutrients in the soil for efficient plant uptake. Therefore, it is important to test the soil to determine which nutrients are excessive. This enables business apply fertilizers and waste according to actual crop demand because too much water increases nutrient losses, while too little water limits nutrient uptake. All the activities depend on data visibility to make decisions more accurate and reduce resource waste. However, applying this model is not only a technical issue but also an infrastructure and economic challenge. In rural areas, the lack of collection hubs where agricultural residues can be stored and processed (Parajuli et al,. 2019; Humberto et al., 2025), combined with operation costs higher than short-term benefits, are barriers that prevents suppliers from adopting change (Hilmi et al., 2024). Moreover, yields could decline in the early transition period because the farming system needs time to rebalance (Enock Siankwilimba et al., 2025). When biological methods are applied, beneficial microbial communities need time to recover, and soil health improves. The role of responsible governance must be demonstrated at that time through supporting technology and sharing benefits between the organization and small suppliers (Zhong et al., 2022).

2.4 Proposed solution
Based on the analysis in the previous section, this proposed solution focuses on establishing a digital traceability system, which is widely acknowledged as a data management system to achieve SDG 12 goals more effectively and support the transition of suppliers/companies to a circular economy in crop agriculture (Anastasiadis et al., 2022). The system collects data, stores, and makes transparent all cultivation actions from the origin of input resources, the volume of water and chemicals used during the crop growing process. Furthermore, the methods of handling excess by-products are also stored. This data will be standardized and audited to serve sustainability KPIs, including inorganic fertilizer usage per hectare, by-product recycling rate, cubic meters of water consumed per unit of product, etc (Freeman et al., 2022)
However, to implement this method, it is necessary to use tools such as IoT sensors embedded deep in the soil to measure soil moisture, combined with smart irrigation systems that spray below optimal thresholds. With that, this also reduces the amount of water usage for irrigation, resulting in resource management efficiency (Figure 2). This tool has the ability to analyze soil nutrients, which enables farms to apply precision fertilization processes, and is a way to decrease excess inputs (García et al., 2020). This also prevents any leaching of harmful chemicals to the groundwater and reduces the use of fossil fuel-based fertilizers. All information is stored in blockchain and synchronized through the supply chain. (Caro et al., 2018). It aids in data analysis and provides real-time transparency to the stakeholders to address the deficiency of clarity in sustainability reports. Weak resource use is also disclosed through transparency and creates reputational and compliance pressure. Thus, a strategic move that is founded on good governance and increased risk tolerance is needed.

2.5 Implementation plan
There is a need to implement traceability in global crop agriculture that follows a phased roadmap (Figure 3). In the short-term phase, the main focus is improve basic infrastructure at farms, which could gain raw data in a stable and continuous way. After that, once enough reliable data is collected, the system moves to the optimization phase at the level of agricultural procurement companies, which need to meet higher standards.

 
 
Figure 3: PDCA Implementation Roadmap
3. Risk Analysis 
3.1 Identify risk
The risks indicated in the traceability include monetary load, information voids, and the reliability of data. A large investment and time are required to establish the infrastructure of technology, particularly since IoT devices and blockchain storage are costly (Karnaushenko et al., 2023). Thus, farms in rural areas could face difficulties due to unstable networks, and these costs are often higher than their profits from their crops (Ahmed, De and Hussain, 2018). Secondly, the power asymmetry could occur between firms and farms (Glavee-Geo, Engelseth and Buvik, 2021). Although the data on volume, water usage, and fertilizer input are collected centrally, the firm can analyze data from numerous farms to fully understand the production situation. While farms are limited to their own local data, they can face price suppression or be forced into disadvantageous terms (Ryan, 2020). Lastly, cybersecurity is where external attacks and fraud risks can happen at any time (Agarwal et al., 2024). Even though the data cannot change after input, as it is transferred throughout multiple intermediaries, this technology cannot verify the initial input. Hence, these data could be added manually with false figures to do "greenwashing," which fails to achieve the transparency goal of SDG 12.5 (Nygaard and Silkoset, 2022).
This method also has indirect risks. The impact of natural disasters such as storms, floods, and droughts can destroy technological devices, as the hardware is all installed outdoors, although this risk has a low likelihood of occurrence. Beyond that, the digital traceability only monitors direct partners (tier 1). In deeper tiers of the supply chain, like fertilizer manufacturers and energy input suppliers (tier 2, tier 3) (Fraser et al., 2020), they often have high emission levels and engage in direct resource extraction. These suppliers are out of the monitoring scope of the downstream businesses. The firm/farm can be associated with environmentally harmful activities without being aware of it.
3.2 Critical Assessment of Risks 
Risk profile assessment must prioritise critical paths with the most potential to cause systemic disruption. Based on the risk matrix framework (Figure 4)  (Manuj and Mentzer, 2008), the result shows that a high level of risk is not only related to technical factors but also primarily comes from data and finance issues. Especially, the risk of inaccurate traceability data (R2) is considered one of the most serious threats. If the input data is false, resource management decisions based on it will become flawed. This directly reduces the ability to use resources effectively in implementing SDG 12 goals. In this case, the contrast between the risk of cybersecurity (R4) and natural disasters (R6) indicates that the level of impact must be the determining factor in prioritisation. Although both of the risks have a low likelihood of occurrence, R4 has a high-level risk due to the serious consequences of data loss or system disruption, whereas R6 is only rated as low risk. This reflects that the rare risks of causing systemic catastrophe must be given priority for mitigation over risks that cause less damage, even if they occur more frequently (Grant et al., 2023, 211-225) 
 
Figure 4: Risk Assessment Matrix for Digital Traceability 
3.3 Risk Treatment
Based on Figure 4, mitigation measures are focused on three main groups. In the first group, it is necessary to solve the high-probability risks with major consequences. To limit financial risk, the companies and farms should adopt a step-by-step approach by establishing basic systems first, like IoT for a single plot of land, rather than tackling the entire supply chain (Chicaiza et al., 2024). Limited visibility in lower levels (R7) is a crucial trade-off in order to be focused on core finances before the expansion. In addition, the accuracy of data (R2) should be maintained through the normalization of entry processes and the reduction of manual work. Only the management level can feed in incidents manually, and their annual audits can verify odd data. Access control and encryption should be closely controlled and used in securing the system as per the international requirements, such as ISO/IEC 27001 (ISO, 2022). IT personnel are to conduct weekly inspections to identify and resolve vulnerabilities in a timely manner and safeguard production.
At the medium-risk, the organizations are recommended to establish trust with the farms by using the SRM model to mitigate the risk of power imbalance (R3). This assists in transparency with definite contracts. Rather than concealing prices, companies ought to get into long-term purchasing agreements and share analysis and technical advice in favor of production (Ruml and Qaim, 2020). The sustainable achievements in KPI will also be reviewed based on the reliable traceability data (R5) (Chandan, John and Potdar, 2023). Even though transparency reveals weaknesses in production, companies can take this as a learning device to realign governance, slowly attaining SDG 12 goals.
The priority, as far as natural disaster risks (R6) are concerned, is hardware protection and planning. Outdoor equipment requires weatherproof covers (IP67/68) to remain dry (Cecchetti and Ruscelli, 2024). Insurance of all the devices as well as infrastructure, should be provided to receive financial assistance in case they are damaged.
Crop agriculture requires collective policies of the local government to curb every risk and achieve SDG 12. The government must establish national standards equal to international standards, such as ISO 22005 (Bosona and Gebresenbet, 2023), and provide funding to small farms to purchase IoT devices. Another task that requires the development of a legal framework to ensure the security of data ownership is to ensure that large firms do not use data (Carbonell, 2016; Wiseman et al., 2019).
4. Conclusion
The world crop production is one that depletes resources, destroys soil, squanders water, and abuses fertilizer, which is a manifestation of the weaknesses of governance. Furthermore, the linear model remains hegemonic given its emphasis on the short-term yields that are detrimental to long term food security and consumer health. In response, the digital traceability turns out to be an important tool to shift the guesswork to the evidence. By using IoT sensors, it provides real-time data that can help to transform to a circular economy by enhancing the efficiency of water and fertilizer consumption and resource conservation. However, the approach has the financial risk of initial high costs and power imbalance in data that has blocked the achievement of SDG 12. As a result, the method is successful only in the case of effective governance and high levels of cybersecurity that prevent any disturbances in the system. Ultimately, with the support of the government, traceability is not a financial burden to small farms, resulting in building a crop agriculture in line with global sustainability goals.

Appendix A
From the very first stage of learning this module, I had a very basic and narrow-minded view of the responsibility of the supply chain. I grew up in a developing country, where economic development is prioritized over sustainability. Besides, my mindset was strongly influenced by my previous company, which is a laundry detergent company. I understood that the role of the supply chain was to ensure smooth operations in all company activities, and the main core of the company was to generate profits. Hence, I thought the company mainly focused on people, profit, and product to develop strategies.
During the lectures, I tried to understand all the given frameworks and theories. Based on the knowledge, I realized that the global issues, such as climate change and resource depletion, are partly driven by weak supply chain management at the manufacturing company (Hendiani et al., 2020). Especially, the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) of John Elkington (1997) significantly changed the way I think. This framework pushed me to ask critical questions: How does our production process impact the workers involved? What are the consequences for our community? And what footprint do we leave on the environment?" Based on this question, I researched and explored that in order to develop sustainably in the future, the company not only focuses on financial profit but also considers social responsibility (People) and environmental stewardship (Planet) (Alhaddi, 2015). With smooth supply chain operation, the company must find methods for reducing waste and greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing into the environment, and use natural resources effectively. In addition, the responsibility of the company lies in ensuring ethical behavior with employees, stakeholders, and the community. I went through companies like Unilever and P&G, and realized that they have successfully applied TBL in supply chain management by investing in social activities and setting sustainability targets each year.
As a consumer, I will change my consumption behavior by researching the origin of products and buying products that align with sustainable values. Because consumers are a company’s main stakeholders, moving from awareness to action is one way to support the company in applying TBL.
If I become a supply chain manager in the future, the first thing I would do is apply the TBL framework to improve the organization’s sustainable development. For example, in a laundry detergent company, it is important to ensure a safe working environment for manufacturing workers due to their exposure to toxic chemicals. With that, I will prioritise choosing materials with a bio-based active ingredient and a recyclable packaging design, which provides transparency for consumers. These actions create a competitive advantage that allows the company to generate profits from green products. (Ilyas R.A et al., 2021)
In summary, this module sharpens my understanding of a responsible supply chain, especially in TBL. It became clear that profit remains a business priority; it cannot sustain long-term success. As environmental issues are increasing, international policies force companies to consider their responsibilities to communities rather than focusing only on individual corporate benefits.
